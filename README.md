# Slackbot-to-salesforce

Two options for connecting slack to salesforce. One uses the real time message API, the other sets up a handler for a slash command

Several configuration files for Prod and QA for both sfdc and slack. This was created using google's cloud services (appengine)

This project is from about a year ago.
