# Slackbot-to-salesforce

Two options for connecting slack to salesforce. One uses the real time message API, the other sets up a handler for a slash command

Several configuration files for Prod and QA for both sfdc and slack. There is also an environment variable within the app.yaml that controls which set of config files to use.  This was created using google's cloud services (appengine)

This project is from about a year ago.
